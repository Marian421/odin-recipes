    <h1>Potato salad</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This classic potato salad is the best. Creamy, tangy, and crunchy, with a hint of spice and sweetness from pickles, 
        it reminds me of my grandmother's potato salad served every Easter, or any time we had barbecue. She always dotted 
        it with olives for a finishing touch, and a perfect briny addition. This is the best classic version of good 
        old-fashioned, Southern-style potato salad. Not too much mayonnaise, with just the right amount of tang!
         Serve with grilled or smoked meats, it's the perfect side dish.</p>
